        Hello everyone my name is Orlando, yes like the city in Florida. I'm a bit of a novice when it comes to Web Devolpment, I have self taught myself in HTML so this is'nt to hard for me to do. I really enjoy coding because I like the diffuculty that come with it. Theres plenty to learn about it so I am very excited to learn more. I very much enjoy to play video games as that is what I do with my free time. There is alot of differnet games that I play ranging from puzzles to shooters and even fighting games. My all time favorite game is the Halo franchise.
